# Multi-Bus Visibility Policy

This document defines when a CANoe node may require visibility to more than one bus/database in the active SIL configuration.

## 1. Principle

The active CANoe runtime uses:

- domain CAN databases for ECU/runtime CAN messages
- UDP-based Ethernet transport for inter-domain backbone contracts

The key rule is:

- what is required is a **gateway/visibility function**
- not necessarily a separate top-level visible "gateway ECU"

Visible surface nodes remain OEM-style ECU names. Additional bus/database visibility is restored in GUI only where runtime code consumes or publishes messages outside the node's primary domain.

Important distinction:

- **Primary placement** in this document means the node's normal source/mirror grouping and visible owner grouping
- **Ethernet runtime placement** means whether that node must actually stay attached to the GUI TCP/IP stack / `ETH_Backbone (Eth 1)` runtime topology
- **Ethernet runtime placement** is not the same thing as **extra CAN DBC visibility**
- nodes may remain grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror structure without needing live Ethernet runtime participation
- multibus assignment is driven by **foreign-domain CAN message visibility**, not by old backbone stub seams

GUI interpretation rule:

- if `Ethernet runtime placement in GUI = required`, keep `ETH_Backbone` in the node's `Assigned buses` and keep its TCP/IP stack interface
- if `Ethernet runtime placement in GUI = not required`, remove `ETH_Backbone` from the node's `Assigned buses`; CANoe will then drop the live Ethernet node/interface automatically
- do **not** try to represent `not required` by clearing only IPv4 settings while leaving the node attached to `ETH_Backbone`

Current active runtime direct-ingress rule:

- keep direct Ethernet RX ownership only for `CGW`, `ADAS`, `V2X`, and `TEST_BAS`
- treat other Ethernet-capable nodes as tx-only or internal-contract consumers unless this document explicitly says otherwise
- treat owner, observer, and validation exceptions according to `contracts/layer-separation-policy.md`

## 2. Why Multibus Exists In This Project

Multibus visibility exists for two reasons:

1. Cross-domain runtime dependencies in SIL
- some nodes consume messages produced in another domain database
- some nodes publish to a foreign-domain CAN database while owning a different primary domain role
- these nodes need extra GUI visibility even if they remain a single visible ECU node

2. Full-system validation harness visibility
- `TEST_SCN` injects and observes a complete cross-domain scenario
- it must see the domain CAN contracts that it drives or checks
- this is a validation architecture need, not an Ethernet transport need

## 3. Node Categories

### 3.1 True multibus anchors

These nodes are expected to see multiple CAN databases as part of their normal runtime role.

| Node | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `CGW` | cross-domain boundary and fail-safe authority; consumes `frmChassisHealthMsg`, `frmBodyHealthMsg`, and `frmInfotainmentHealthMsg`, so it requires `Chassis`, `Body`, and `Infotainment` CAN visibility in addition to its ETH runtime placement |
| `TEST_SCN` | validation scenario orchestration and full-system signal injection/observation; emits or observes `Powertrain`, `Chassis`, `Body`, `Infotainment`, and `ADAS` domain contracts, so it requires all five domain CAN databases in addition to its ETH runtime placement |

### 3.2 CAN-primary nodes that need cross-domain assignment

These nodes stay grouped in their **primary CAN domain** in source/mirror and visible owner placement, but may still require:

- Ethernet topology placement for active backbone UDP participation
- extra foreign-domain CAN visibility for runtime message references

| Node | Primary source/mirror placement | Ethernet runtime placement in GUI | Extra CAN visibility to attach | Compile-validated reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PGS` | `Infotainment` | not required | `ADAS` | consumes `frmParkUltrasonicStateMsg` |
| `AFLS` | `Body` | not required | `Chassis` | consumes `frmSteeringAngleMsg` |
| `DATC` | `Body` | not required | `Infotainment` | consumes `frmTmuServiceStateMsg` |
| `ACU` | `Chassis` | not required | `Body` | consumes `frmSeatBeltStateMsg` |
| `ODS` | `Chassis` | not required | `Body` | consumes `frmSeatBeltStateMsg`, `frmSeatStateMsg` |
| `ADAS` | `ADAS` | required | `Chassis`, `Body`, `Infotainment`, `Powertrain` | consumes cross-domain CAN context and remains a direct Ethernet ingress owner for ADAS-specific object-risk input while publishing backbone ETH seams |
| `BCM` | `Body` | not required | `Chassis`, `Infotainment`, `ADAS` | consumes `frmVehicleStateCanMsg`, `frmPhoneAsKeyStateMsg`, `frmTmuServiceStateMsg`, `frmTurnLampInputMsg`, and `frmAdasDomainStateMsg`; no direct backbone socket remains |
| `IVI` | `Infotainment` | required | `Chassis`, `ADAS` | consumes `frmVehicleStateCanMsg` and `frmAdasDomainStateMsg` while publishing `ethNavContextMsg`; keep Ethernet runtime placement for TX only, no direct backbone RX remains |
| `SCC` | `ADAS` | not required | `Powertrain`, `Chassis` | publishes `frmCruiseStateMsg` and consumes `frmVehicleStateCanMsg` |
| `HWP` | `ADAS` | not required | `Powertrain` | consumes `frmCruiseStateMsg` |
| `VCU` | `Chassis` | required | `Powertrain`, `Infotainment` | consumes `frmIgnitionEngineMsg`, `frmGearStateMsg`, `frmVehicleModeMsg`, and `frmNavModuleStateMsg` while publishing `ethVehicleStateMsg`; keep Ethernet runtime placement for TX only, no direct backbone RX remains |
| `MDPS` | `Chassis` | required | none | publishes `ethSteeringMsg`; keep GUI Ethernet runtime placement for TX only, and do not add foreign CAN DBCs for ETH alone |
| `CLU` | `Infotainment` | not required | `ADAS` | consumes `frmAdasDomainStateMsg`; no direct backbone socket remains |

### 3.3 ETH_Backbone-primary nodes

These nodes stay grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror and visible owner placement. Some of them still require additional CAN DBC visibility because they reference domain CAN messages, but only a subset still requires live Ethernet runtime placement in GUI.

| Node | Primary source/mirror placement | Ethernet runtime placement in GUI | Extra CAN visibility to attach | Compile-validated reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CGW` | `ETH_Backbone` | required | `Chassis`, `Body`, `Infotainment` | consumes `frmChassisHealthMsg`, `frmBodyHealthMsg`, `frmInfotainmentHealthMsg`, `frmVehicleStateCanMsg`, `frmSteeringStateCanMsg`, and `frmNavigationRouteMsg` |
| `TEST_SCN` | `ETH_Backbone` | required | `Powertrain`, `Chassis`, `Body`, `Infotainment`, `ADAS` | validation scenario orchestration and full-system cross-domain signal injection/observation |
| `V2X` | `ETH_Backbone` | required | none | backbone emergency ingress/monitor owner; direct RX is retained for `EmergencyAlert` ingress only |
| `EXT_DIAG` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | none | logical external diagnostic observer/requester placeholder; reads `Diag::*` only, adds no new DBC dependency, and has no direct backbone RX/TX in the current baseline |
| `DCM` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | `Infotainment` | keep node grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove GUI Ethernet runtime placement; consumes `frmNavModuleStateMsg` and `frmClusterNotifMsg`, and reads fail-safe from internal contracts; no direct backbone RX or ETH TX path remains |
| `ETHB` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | `Infotainment` | keep node grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove GUI Ethernet runtime placement; consumes `frmNavModuleStateMsg` and `frmClusterNotifMsg`, and reads fail-safe from internal contracts; no direct backbone RX or ETH TX path remains |
| `SGW` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | `Chassis`, `Infotainment` | keep node grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove GUI Ethernet runtime placement; consumes `frmVehicleStateCanMsg`, `frmNavModuleStateMsg`, and `frmClusterNotifMsg`, and reads fail-safe from internal contracts; no direct backbone RX or ETH TX path remains |
| `IBOX` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | `Chassis`, `Infotainment`, `ADAS` | keep node grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove GUI Ethernet runtime placement; consumes `frmVehicleStateCanMsg`, `frmNavModuleStateMsg`, `frmNavigationRouteMsg`, and `frmAdasDomainStateMsg`; no direct backbone RX or ETH TX path remains |
| `EDR` | `ETH_Backbone` | not required | `ADAS` | keep node grouped under `ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove GUI Ethernet runtime placement; consumes `frmAdasDomainStateMsg` and internal object/fail-safe contracts; no direct backbone RX or ETH TX path remains |
| `TEST_BAS` | `ETH_Backbone` | required | none | shared observer and sysvar aggregation seam; reload `project.sysvars` when observer vars drift |

Practical reading rule:

- if `Primary source/mirror placement = ETH_Backbone` and `Ethernet runtime placement in GUI = required`, keep the node on the GUI TCP/IP stack
- if `Primary source/mirror placement = ETH_Backbone` and `Ethernet runtime placement in GUI = not required`, keep the node under `channel_assign/ETH_Backbone` in source/mirror, but remove `ETH_Backbone` from the GUI node's `Assigned buses`
- if `Primary source/mirror placement = Chassis/Body/Infotainment/ADAS/...` and `Ethernet runtime placement in GUI = required`, the node is dual-homed by design: keep its primary CAN grouping and also attach it to GUI Ethernet runtime

## 4. Why `TEST_BAS` Stays Single-Bus

`TEST_BAS` is intentionally different from `TEST_SCN`.

### 4.1 What `TEST_BAS` actually does

`TEST_BAS`:

- receives `Test::scenarioResult`
- computes the baseline aggregate result
- writes summarized validation state to `Test::baseScenarioId`, `Test::baseScenarioResult`, `Test::baseFlowCoverageMask`, `Test::baseTraceSnapshotId`, and `Test::baseTestHealth`

This is now a **sysvar-only validation aggregation path**.

Source references:

- [TEST_BAS.can](../../src/capl/ecu/TEST_BAS.can)
- [project.sysvars](../../project/sysvars/project.sysvars)

### 4.2 Why this is still "system-wide" validation

`TEST_BAS` is not a raw multi-domain collector.

System-wide information is already condensed before it reaches `TEST_BAS`:

- `TEST_SCN` orchestrates scenario inputs across domains
- runtime ECUs evaluate and publish/reflect state
- `TEST_SCN` updates `Test::scenarioResult`
- `TEST_BAS` only aggregates the final baseline result state

So:

- the **validation meaning** is system-wide
- the **transport dependency** for `TEST_BAS` is intentionally narrow
- the **topology placement** stays on the backbone-side validation seam, not in a product chassis ECU and not inside `CGW`

That is why `TEST_BAS` remains single-bus while `TEST_SCN` remains multibus.

### 4.3 When `TEST_BAS` would need multibus

Only change this if `TEST_BAS` begins to directly consume raw cross-domain CAN messages instead of the current summarized sysvar chain.

Under the current design, widening `TEST_BAS` adds complexity without improving the validation architecture.

## 5. GUI Restore Rule

When rebuilding a fresh `.cfg`:

1. keep one visible node instance per ECU
2. attach the five domain CAN DBCs first
3. place ETH-capable nodes on the Ethernet topology as required by the configuration
4. restore extra CAN visibility only for the nodes listed in this document
5. do not duplicate nodes just to make message names visible

Compile-guided shortcut:

- if `CGW`, `TEST_SCN`, `ADAS`, `BCM`, `IVI`, `CLU`, `DCM`, `ETHB`, `SGW`, `IBOX`, `EDR`, `HWP`, `SCC`, `ACU`, `ODS`, `AFLS`, `DATC`, `PGS`, or `VCU` show `Database missing?` errors, treat that as missing foreign-domain CAN visibility first
- if `TEST_BAS` shows `Test::base*` variable errors, reload `project.sysvars`
- if `EXT_DIAG` shows `Diag::*` variable errors, reload `project.sysvars`; do not add foreign CAN DBCs as a workaround
- do not reintroduce a retired backbone stub DBC as a workaround for missing foreign CAN visibility

## 6. Current DBC Set For Multibus Assignment

Use these as the primary multibus assignment set:

- `chassis_can.dbc`
- `body_can.dbc`
- `infotainment_can.dbc`
- `powertrain_can.dbc`
- `adas_can.dbc`

## 7. Design Intent

The active SIL design is intentionally Ethernet-ready at the seam:

- now: `UDP / Ethernet handler`
- local/domain CAN remains for domain-local ECU contracts

The target is to preserve downstream ECU decision logic and use multibus only where foreign-domain CAN visibility is genuinely required.
