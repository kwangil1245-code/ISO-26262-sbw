# Diagnostic SysVar Contract

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This document reflects the current development baseline and the planned target architecture.
> Some runtime, diagnostic, and verification details are still under implementation and may change.

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the stable diagnostic observation contract exposed through `Diag::*` system variables.

The goal is to keep diagnostic request/response evidence visible to:

- validation logic
- trace reviewers
- panel or tool observers

without turning product runtime code into ad-hoc debug wiring.

## 2. Scope

This contract covers the active `Diag` namespace in:

- `project/sysvars/project.sysvars`

This document defines meaning and usage rules, not service-specific UDS content.

## 3. Namespace baseline

The active diagnostic namespace is:

- `Diag`

It contains request mirrors, response mirrors, counters, timestamps, session/security observers, and domain health summary mirrors.

## 4. Request-side contract

| SysVar | Meaning | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Diag::LastRequestTarget` | target ECU or service code of the most recent diagnostic request | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastRequestSid` | service identifier of the most recent request | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastRequestDidHigh` | DID high byte for the most recent request | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastRequestDidLow` | DID low byte for the most recent request | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastRequestSourceBus` | source bus code used for the request | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::RequestCounter` | monotonic request count | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastRequestTimeMs` | most recent request timestamp in ms | current executable baseline: `DCM` synthetic request mirror; target architecture: `EXT_DIAG` or later diagnostic tester path | verification and evidence tools |

## 5. Response-side contract

| SysVar | Meaning | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Diag::LastResponseTarget` | target ECU or service code of the most recent response | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseCode` | response code of the most recent response | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseData0` | first response payload byte for summary observation | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseData1` | second response payload byte for summary observation | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseOk` | positive/negative result flag for the latest response | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseSourceBus` | source bus code used for the response | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ResponseCounter` | monotonic response count | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::LastResponseTimeMs` | most recent response timestamp in ms | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |

## 6. Verdict-facing seam contract

| SysVar | Meaning | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Diag::SecurityState` | current diagnostic security interpretation for verification | diagnostic/security seam producer | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ServiceState` | current service availability interpretation for verification | diagnostic/service seam producer | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::RouteOwner` | active route ownership interpretation for the latest diagnostic-linked verdict | gateway/runtime diagnostic seam producer | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ResponseKind` | semantic response class for the latest diagnostic-linked verdict | diagnostic response handler | verification and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ReasonCode` | compact verdict-facing reason code for the latest diagnostic-linked decision | diagnostic/service/security seam producer | verification and evidence tools |

These variables are verdict-facing semantic seams.

They are not a replacement for full transport trace or full tester payload review.

## 6.1 Session and security observer contract

| SysVar | Meaning | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Diag::SessionState` | current diagnostic session summary | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::TesterPresentActive` | whether the current diagnostic path is considered actively maintained | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::GatewayOpen` | whether the gateway currently allows the active diagnostic route | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::AuthState` | current diagnostic authentication summary | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::SecurityFault` | compact security fault summary code | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::SecurityPolicy` | compact security policy summary code | `SGW` security/session observer | panel and evidence tools |

These variables are observer-facing semantic mirrors for the external diagnostic console.

They are intended to show what the vehicle-side gateway currently believes about the diagnostic path.

## 6.2 Domain health summary contract

| SysVar | Meaning | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Diag::AdasHealthLevel` | ADAS diagnostic health summary | `ADAS` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::BodyDiagState` | Body domain diagnostic state summary | `BCM` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::BodyFailCode` | Body domain fail-code summary | `BCM` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ChassisDiagState` | Chassis domain diagnostic state summary | `ESC` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::ChassisFailCode` | Chassis domain fail-code summary | `ESC` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::InfoDiagState` | Infotainment domain diagnostic state summary | `IVI` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::InfoFailCode` | Infotainment domain fail-code summary | `IVI` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::PtDiagState` | Powertrain domain diagnostic state summary | `VCU` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |
| `Diag::PtFailCode` | Powertrain domain fail-code summary | `VCU` domain health producer | panel and evidence tools |

These health fields are panel-friendly observer mirrors.

They exist so the diagnostic console can display domain health without binding directly to DBC messages.

## 7. Contract rules

### 7.1 `Diag::*` is an observation contract

`Diag::*` exists to mirror what happened.

It must not become the only place where diagnostic meaning lives.

Product behavior should still be implemented through the actual diagnostic runtime path.
In the current target architecture, request-side origin belongs to `EXT_DIAG`, not `TEST_SCN`.

### 7.2 Counters are cumulative

`RequestCounter` and `ResponseCounter` are cumulative mirrors for the active session/runtime scope.

Do not reuse them as boolean flags.

In the current executable baseline, `RequestCounter` advances when the synthetic request identity changes or when the `DCM` semantic transaction tuple changes (`ServiceState`, `ResponseKind`, `ReasonCode`).

This is an evidence-oriented mirror rule for the current SIL baseline, not a claim that a full external transport request was emitted.

### 7.3 Timestamps are in milliseconds

`LastRequestTimeMs` and `LastResponseTimeMs` are millisecond timestamps.

Keep this unit stable across tooling and evidence review.

### 7.4 Bus-code interpretation must stay consistent

`LastRequestSourceBus` and `LastResponseSourceBus` are valid only if all producers and consumers use the same code mapping.

If the bus-code enum changes, update this document and the matching runtime/test helpers together.

Current executable baseline:

- `1 = ETH_Backbone`
- request/response target code `2 = DCM summary endpoint`

### 7.5 Response summary fields are for evidence, not full payload transport

`LastResponseData0` and `LastResponseData1` are summary mirrors.

They are useful for quick evidence and smoke validation, but they do not replace a full diagnostic payload trace when deeper analysis is required.

### 7.6 Verdict-facing seams are semantic, not payload-complete

`SecurityState`, `ServiceState`, `RouteOwner`, `ResponseKind`, and `ReasonCode` exist to make the official verdict readable and stable.

They must not become an ad-hoc dumping surface for every internal diagnostic detail.

Prefer a small stable semantic vocabulary over rapidly changing implementation-only values.

## 8. Verification usage

Use `Diag::*` for:

- smoke confirmation that a request was sent
- smoke confirmation that a response returned
- pass/fail gating for positive or negative response expectation
- evidence correlation with trace and write-window logs
- verdict-facing interpretation for the current official diagnostic scope

Do not use `Diag::*` as the only proof when a full transport trace is required.

## 9. Update rule

If a diagnostic runtime path changes:

1. update the `Diag::*` producer/consumer logic
2. update `project/sysvars/project.sysvars` if the variable surface changes
3. update this contract document
4. update verification documents that depend on the changed evidence semantics
